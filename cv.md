## About Me
#### I am a student of the Belarusian National Technical University. By specialty design engineer in the field of mechanical engineering. During my studies, I realized that this direction does not bring me pleasure, but I was able to learn to constantly develop, work in a team and not be afraid of difficulties. In the future, I plan to apply these skills in programming.
